        "  Function-\n",
        "  The client is a device or application that requests services or resources from the server. It typically runs on a user's machine (e.g., a laptop, smartphone, or web browser).\n",
        "  2. Server:\n",
        "  Function-\n",
        "  The server is a machine or software application that provides resources or services to clients. It processes requests from clients and returns the appropriate responses.\n",
        "  3. Communication Protocol:\n",
        "  Function-\n",
        "  This governs how the client and server communicate with each other. It ensures data is transmitted in a standardized way.  \n",
        "  4. Network:\n",
        "  Function-\n",
        "  The network is the medium through which the client and server communicate, which could be a local network (LAN) or the internet (WAN).\n",
        "  5. Database:\n",
        "  Function-\n",
        "  In many client-server setups, the server is connected to a database to store and manage data.\n",

        " js, React, GitHub, Sass, ESLint, Figma, and Jest are among the most important ones a developer of web applications will ever use these days.

        "\n",
        " ->Benefits of version control systems. Using version control software is a best practice for high performing software and DevOps teams.\n",
        " Version control also helps developers move faster and allows software teams to preserve efficiency and agility as the team scales to include more developers.\n",
        " 1. Collaboration-One of the biggest benefits of using a version control system is the ability to collaborate with other team members. With Git, multiple people can work on the same codebase at the same time and see each other's changes in real time.\n",
        " 2. Code Review-\n",
        "Another advantage of using Git is the ability to perform code reviews. When a team member submits a change to the codebase, other team members can review the changes and provide feedback before the code is merged into the main branch.\n",
        " 3. History and Auditing-\n",
        "With Git, you can view the entire history of a project, including every change made and who made it. This can be extremely useful for debugging or reviewing past work.\n",
        " 4. Revert Changes-\n",
        "If something goes wrong or you want to go back to a previous version, you can easily revert changes with Git.\n",
        " 5. Branching-\n",
        "Git also allows you to create branches, which are separate versions of your codebase.\n",
